    PROMPT: Create a concise function analysis summary

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Analyze all functions and provide a minimal but comprehensive overview:

    Function Analysis:
    - List all functions with their primary purpose (one line max)
    - Include only essential parameters (name and type if typed)
    - Note return type only if explicitly defined
    - Flag only: async, generator, constructor, or security-sensitive functions
    - List direct dependencies only (called functions, not callers)
    - Include only critical side effects or state mutations

    Class Analysis:
    - Class name, parent class, and one-line purpose
    - List method names only (no details unless critical)

    Global Scope:
    - List imports, exports, and entry point only

    Output Format (exclude empty fields):
    {
      "language": "detected language",
      "functions": [
        {
          "name": "functionName",
          "type": "only if not regular function",
          "purpose": "one line description",
          "params": ["param1: type", "param2?: type"],
          "returns": "type only if explicit",
          "async": true, // only if true
          "calls": ["critical dependencies only"],
          "sideEffects": "only if significant",
          "security": "only if security-relevant"
        }
      ],
      "classes": [
        {
          "name": "ClassName",
          "extends": "ParentClass",
          "purpose": "one line",
          "methods": ["method1", "method2"]
        }
      ],
      "imports": ["module names only"],
      "exports": ["exported items"],
      "entryPoint": "main() or initialization"
    }

    Keep descriptions under 10 words. Omit obvious information.

    ${user_prompt}

    Format the output.
    For javascript use StandardJS but include semicolumns.
    For html use W3C standards.
    Skip files that dont need to be changed and are provided for reference.
    Don't refactor code that is not needed to be changed.
    Comment as needed.
    Add comments to new lines and modified sections.

  smart_prompt: |-
    Based on the user's request below, identify which of the provided files are directly or indirectly necessary to fulfill the request. The user has provided a list of files with their automated analysis (overview and function summaries). Your task is to act as a filter. Only return the file paths that are relevant. Return your answer as a single, minified JSON object with a single key "relevant_files" which is an array of strings. Each string must be one of the file paths provided in the "AVAILABLE FILES" section. Do not include any other text or explanation.
    
    Example response: {"relevant_files":["src/user.js","src/api/auth.js"]}

    USER REQUEST: ${user_prompt}

    AVAILABLE FILES AND THEIR ANALYSIS:
    ${analysis_data_string}

  qa: |-
    You are an expert software developer assistant. Based *only* on the code provided in the context below, answer the user's question. Format your answer clearly using Markdown. If the question cannot be answered from the provided context, say so and explain why.

    CONTEXT:
    ${file_context}

    QUESTION:
    ${user_question}

  auto_select: |-
    You are an intelligent file filter. Your task is to identify which of the following files are part of the core, user-written project source code, and which are likely third-party libraries, dependencies, configuration files, or build artifacts.

    Analyze the list of file paths and the first 256 characters of their content.

    Return a single, minified JSON object with a single key "project_files", which is an array of strings. Each string must be a file path from the provided list that you identify as core project code.

    Considerations:
    - Files in directories like 'src', 'app', 'components', 'controllers', 'models' are likely project files.
    - Files in directories like 'vendor', 'node_modules', 'dist', 'build', 'assets' are likely NOT project files.
    - Files with common library names (e.g., 'jquery.js', 'bootstrap.css') are likely NOT project files.
    - Pay attention to the content snippet for clues like copyright notices, minification, or boilerplate code.

    Do not include any other text or explanation in your response.
